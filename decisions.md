# Decisions log

Short, dated decisions made in conversation. Larger, durable decisions get an ADR in `docs/adr/`.

- 2026-11-04 — Product name: Featra. Trademark and registrar check before public release.
- 2026-11-04 — M1 split into M1a (core loop, manual merges) and M1b (auto-merge, approval screen, annotations, UAT,
  knowledge promotion). Remote control is M2.
- 2026-11-04 — Claude is the only provider in M1; Codex and ACP agents in M2.
- 2026-11-04 — Home view is the feature list; the stage board is a read-only secondary view.
- 2026-11-04 — Burn-up counts items (stories and bugs) in both progress modes: task ticks are not history events, so a
  task-level burn-up can't be rebuilt from `history[]`. Feature rows still honour the `tasks` setting.
- 2026-11-04 — In `tasks` progress mode a Done story counts all its tasks as done.
- 2026-11-04 — Acceptance is explicit: `accepted`/`withdrawn` events. Moving a card back does not silently revoke it.
- 2026-11-04 — Claude provider: Agent SDK with `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` set to the user's installed `claude`
  (the T3 Code pattern). Featra never offers a login or reads credentials. Anthropic's SDK terms make this a grey
  area; an API-key provider is on the roadmap as a fallback. See `docs/spike-claude-sdk.md`.
- 2026-11-04 — Sessions keep the SDK's default `settingSources` (user, project, local) so they behave like the user's
  own `claude`.
- 2026-11-04 — TypeScript is restricted to erasable syntax (`erasableSyntaxOnly`) so packages run under Node's
  built-in type stripping without a build step.
- 2026-11-05 — Researcher stories (no code, so no CI) reach Done on the user's Accept alone, whatever `requireAccept` says.
  All other stories still need Verified.
- 2026-11-05 — STORY-18 app shell:
  - The window is frameless and the client draws the title bar, with its own minimise/maximise/close on Windows and
    Linux. macOS keeps its native traffic lights (`titleBarStyle: hiddenInset`).
  - The Menu button opens a standard File / Edit / View / Help menu with cascading submenus (sent back by the user;
    replaces the first flat developer menu). Only items that work today are listed; later stories add theirs. The model
    is `packages/client/src/menu.ts`, and the Keyboard shortcuts dialog is generated from it, so the two can't drift.
  - Shortcut labels follow each OS: Cmd on macOS (⌘, ⇧⌘Z for Redo), Ctrl+Y for Redo on Windows and Ctrl+Shift+Z on
    Linux. Quit shows the OS's own shortcut: Alt+F4 on Windows (the OS handles it), ⌘Q on macOS (native app menu),
    Ctrl+Q on Linux (handled by the client).
  - Edit items send the command to main, which calls `webContents.undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/selectAll`, the same calls
    Electron's menu roles make. The menu puts focus back on the field the user was in before running an item. The
    keyboard shortcuts for editing are left to Chromium.
  - No native menu on Windows and Linux (`Menu.setApplicationMenu(null)`): Electron's default menu has its own
    zoom and reload accelerators that would bypass the saved state. macOS gets only the `appMenu` and `editMenu` roles,
    for the menu bar, ⌘Q and the system edit shortcuts.
  - Zoom steps are Chromium's (50%–200%). Zoom and theme are saved in `ui-state.json` with the sidebar state; unknown
    values fall back to 100% and System. A stored zoom between steps snaps to the nearest one.
  - Theme Light/Dark sets `data-theme` on `<html>` (pinning the CSS tokens) and `nativeTheme.themeSource` (native
    surfaces, window background); System removes both overrides. Main applies the stored theme before the window opens.
  - In a plain browser tab the menu leaves out Quit and Troubleshooting, which can't work there.
  - Keyboard shortcuts and About are modal dialogs: the app behind is inert, Tab stays inside, Escape closes, and focus
    returns to where it was. About reads the version from the desktop package (`app.getVersion()`).
  - The title bar shows the view title only ("Work"). The mockup's "· manager" project suffix waits for STORY-19.
  - Window chrome state (sidebar collapsed, zoom, theme) is `ui-state.json` in Electron's `userData`, written by main
    (atomic, flushed before quit), not renderer `localStorage`. `FEATRA_USER_DATA_DIR` overrides the folder. STORY-20
    may fold it into app settings.
  - Back/forward is an in-memory view history; it does not survive a restart.
  - The light palette mirrors the dark mockup. Two colours differ from the mockup to meet AA: the menu shortcut hint uses
    `--tx2` (the mockup's `--tx3` is 3.4:1 on a focused item in dark), and light `--ok` is `#186f3f`.
  - No bundled webfont: Inter if the user has it, else Segoe UI / the system font. Nothing is fetched from Google Fonts.
  - The client talks to the host only through the `FeatraBridge` contract (`packages/client/src/bridge.ts`); a plain
    browser gets a localStorage fallback, which keeps the client usable for remote control later.
  - Main and preload are bundled by Vite to CommonJS, preload on its own because a sandboxed preload can't require chunks.
  - `pnpm test` runs Vitest and then the Electron e2e suite (which builds first); `pnpm test:unit` runs Vitest only.
  - Releases younger than pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` are held back with `overrides` (vite 8.3.5, jsdom 30) or a
    lower range (electron ~45.2.2), not added to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`.
